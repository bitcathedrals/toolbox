# tool

main code is in tool

## overview

This is an old project to manage a knowledge base in XML, using shell and xsltproc into 
install an execute generating a HTML index of the knowledge base.

## Why?

Because I had too much time on my hands and I read the advanced bash scripting guide
and I wanted to make my knowledge base organized, indexed, and portable to be
installed with minimal dependencies.

## Useful?

Maybe for remembering mental gymnastics in shell.
